# CSharp-Project_1
This is a project assignment from my MIS15 course at California State University Sacramento. 
This was our first assignment and were asked to use the Graphics class methods to create an image of an animal that represents us. 
I created custom shapes by simply connecting coordinates and used a mirror image algorithm to reduce the number of shapes I had to create.
